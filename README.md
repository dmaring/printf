_printf is a function that mimics the standard library printf.

Created by Sneha and Drew

We used several helper functions for this project.

_printf: wrote our own function that works as the standard library printf.

print_string: prints the string.

doub_to_str: it converts float and double to string with six prec.

get_form_func: function that checks for the format identifiers and return a pointer.

holberton.h: it contains all the function prototypes that are created for this project.

int_to_str: it converts integer to string (taken care of INT_MIN and INT_MAX)

man_3_printf: created our own man page for the _printf.

_putchar: mimics the standard function putchar.inputs a single character.

_putstr: works similar to print_string function.

str_util: contains the helper functions(strlen, strcat) that are used to find the length and concat 2 strings.

va_print_c: helper function to print character.

va_print_s: helper function to print string.

va_print_i: helper function to print integer.

va_print_d: helper function to print decimal numbers.

Compiling: we used gcc compiler with flags, -werror, -wall, -wextra, -pedantic.
These convert all the warnings into errors.
